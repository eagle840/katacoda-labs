*[rtfm @ www.katacoda.com/docs](https://www.katacoda.com/docs)*

1. need a github account, and understand how to use git
2. need to setup webhook between git and katacoda (see your katacoda profile)

    (when asked,  'friendURL' is local folder name to create)

4. You should see your 1st katacode scenario show up under your profile.
